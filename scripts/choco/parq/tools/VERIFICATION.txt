VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

The embedded software have been built from source held at <https://github.com/elastacloud/parquet-dotnet>

1. The full build script is hosted here: <https://github.com/elastacloud/parquet-dotnet/blob/master/scripts/choco/package.ps1>
2. The build is executed on a hosted file server in Elastacloud 
3. There is no checksum enacted as releases are parquet-dotnet specific and not parq specific. As part of Milestone 2 into Milestone 3 
we are moving Parq to a separate repository which will have releases that can be verified against. Check the task <https://github.com/elastacloud/parquet-dotnet/issues/158> for progress.
